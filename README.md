# chemistry-opencmis

This project is a fork of the [Apache Chemistry OpenCMIS project](https://chemistry.apache.org/). Since this is an Apache Attic project since 2022-02 and the last release 1.1.0 was done in 2017, there is no support for the switch from javax to jakarta.

This fork provides the support for Jakarta and Java 17.
